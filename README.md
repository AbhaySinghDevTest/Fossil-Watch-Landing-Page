# **Landing Page for Fossil-Style Watches** ðŸ•’

 It is best viewed in desktop mode or on a desktop.

 Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (optional), this is a straightforward, tidy **Fossil-inspired landing page** for watches.  Ten to twenty watch products are shown in a chic grid.  By default, each product displays an image, but when you hover over it, important details like type, material, and price become visible.

 Similar to the original [Fossil website](https://www.fossil.com/), the design is {desktop-first}.  Hover effects and CSS Grid are used for interaction.  Media queries up to 750px are used to provide basic responsiveness.

 âœ… The project was submitted for the 2025 WebWarriors Hackathon.
